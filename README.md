## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (vanilla)

### What I learned

I gained practical experience with:

- Dynamically rendering content using JavaScript objects
- Using `clamp()` for responsive typography (Although i didn't later use it)
- Improving layout responsiveness with media queries
- Avoiding default link behavior by using `<button>` instead of `<a href="#">`

### Useful resources

-W3 School - Media Queries
